      <p className='section-text'>
        I am an administrative professional with a solid background in
        diplomatic, real estate, and technology environments. I combine
        organizational precision with genuine curiosity for digital innovation
        and software development. Over the years, I have learned to simplify
        complex workflows, automate processes, and make data work for people. I
        value collaboration, clarity, and efficiency — qualities that help me
        adapt easily to hybrid or remote workplaces. My goal is to contribute to
        a modern, tech-driven organization where reliability meets innovation.
